          </p>

          <h2>LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</h2>
          <p>
            We will only use your Personal Data if we have a proper reason for doing so. We consider the lawful basis for using your Personal Data as set out in the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).<br>
            This include: <br>
        1.    To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.<br>
        2.    To perform a contract with you or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract.<br>
        3.    To use your Personal Data as is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others.<br>
        4.    To protect your interest, the interest of another Data Subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in exercise of official public mandate vested in us.<br>
          </p>

          <h2>Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            The Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) gives you certain rights in respect of the Personal Data we hold about you. Below is a highlight of some of those rights. It is not a complete, exhaustive statement of your rights in respect of your Personal Data:<br>

          1.   You have a right to consent to this Privacy Policy and to withdraw your consent at any time.<br>
          2.   You have a right to a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you, as well as the information about what we do with it, who we share it with and how long we hold it for. We may make a reasonable charge for additional copies of that data in the case of unfounded and excessive requests.<br>
          3.   You have a right to freely transfer your data received from us to any other person.<br>
          4.   You have the right to have the Personal Data we hold about you corrected, if it is factually inaccurate. You may contact us for this purpose.<br>
          5.   In some circumstances, you have the right to the deletion of the information that we hold about you.<br>
          6.   You have a right to lodge a complaint about the handling of your personal information with the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).<br>
          7.   You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your Personal Data to any third party for such purposes.<br>
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            Labano Homes takes reasonable measures to help protect all Personal Data about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Additionally, Labano Homes implements policies designed to protect the confidentiality and security of your nonpublic Personal Data, including a privacy protection policy. Labano Homes limits access to your Personal Data to employees that have a business reason to know such Personal Data, and implement security practices and procedures designed to protect the confidentiality and security of such Personal Data and prohibit unlawful disclosure of such Personal Data in accordance with its policies.<br>

            Where you have chosen a password that allows you to access certain parts of the website and mobile application, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone. We have also taken measures to comply with provision of security facilities for the protection of your Personal Data through the set up of firewalls, limited access to specified authorized individuals, encryption and continuous capacity building for relevant personnel. We therefore have digital and physical security measures to limit and eliminate possibilities of data privacy breach incidents.<br>

            Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your Personal Data, the transmission of data over the internet (including by email) is never completely secure. We endeavour to protect Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data transmitted to us or by us. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
